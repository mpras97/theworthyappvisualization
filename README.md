Once a Covid19 article is published on , we would like to send out a tweet. Along with the tweet, we want to insert the most relevant hashtags for the topic. The popularity of a particular hashtag must also be considered along with relevance.

For example, for an article titled "Oxygen", should we use #Oxygen #Plasma or #Vaccine Should we use also #Treatment What are other related hashtags that could be used for this topic?

The goal is to get maximum number of visitors to visit the article page once we publish and tweet about it.
